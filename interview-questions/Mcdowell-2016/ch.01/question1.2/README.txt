Check Permutation: Give two strings, write a method to decide if is one is
a permutation of the other.


Hint #  1: Define what it means for two strings to be permutations of one another
Hint # 84: There is one solution that is O(n log n). Another uses some space, but
           if O(n) time
Hint #122: Could a hash table be useful?
Hint #131: Two strings that are permutations should have the same chars, but in
           different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
