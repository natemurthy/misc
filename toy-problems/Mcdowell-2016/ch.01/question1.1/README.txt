Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique
characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Hint  # 44: Try a hash table
Hint  #117: Could a bit vector be useful?
Hint  #132: Can you solve it in O(NlogN) time? What might a solution like
            that look like?
